# 👋 Hi, I'm Mekala Maria Sanjith Reddy

🎓 B.Tech Computer Science (Honors), KL University — Class of 2027  
💻 Software Engineering | Machine Learning | Full-Stack | Cloud  
☁️ Microsoft AZ-900 | MongoDB Certified Developer  

I am a Computer Science undergraduate specializing in Data Engineering, currently training as an AI Trainee while building production-style ML pipelines and full-stack systems. My focus is disciplined engineering: strong fundamentals, clean architecture, and real-world problem solving.

I am actively preparing for software, data, and ML roles through hands-on projects, cloud deployments, and structured learning.
